# Genetic Algorithm 
A genetic algorithm is an optimisation technique inspired by natural evolution. It uses concepts like selection, crossover, and mutation to iteratively improve candidate solutions for a problem. The following steps are involved in the implementation of Genetic Algorithm:
- Initialise Population: Randomly generate an initial population of candidate solutions.
- Evaluate Fitness: Assign a fitness score to each solution based on how well it solves the problem.
- Selection: Select the fittest individuals to be parents for the next generation.
- Crossover: Combine the genetic information of two parents to create offspring.
- Mutation: Introduce small random changes to offspring to maintain diversity.
- Repeat: Repeat the process for a fixed number of generations or until a solution is satisfactory.
